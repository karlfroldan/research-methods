\begin{execsummary}
	The Shortest Common Superstring (SCS) problem, known to be NP-Complete,
	seeks the shortest string that contains all strings from a given set.
	This paper provides a detailed summary of SCS problem including the problem's 
	complexity and approximability, and
	shows that DNA sequence assembly be can approached using SCS.
	Then this paper discusses the two most popular approximation algorithms for the 
	SCS problem namely greedy and
	genetic algorithm. Finally, this study presents results supporting the simplicity and performance
	guarantee of the greedy algorithm as well as the convergence of the genetic 
	algorithm to satisfactory approximate solutions as indivuals representing
	problem instances evolve.
