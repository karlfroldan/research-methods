We would write something on this section about the A* pathfinding algorithms and 
other parallel graph pathfinding algorithms written on both imperative and functional languages.

% Several researches have provided in depth study on approximation
% algorithms for the SCS problem.

% Most \cite{Turner1989, Ma2009, Zaritsky2004}, however, considered a greedy algorithm to solve the SCS problem.
% The reason why greed works for shortest common superstring problem was
% explored by \cite{Ma2009}. They explained the good performance 
% of the greedy algorithm by using the smoothed analysis. 
% That is, for any  given instance $I$ of $SCS$, 
% the average approximation ratio of the 
% greedy algorithm on a small random perturbation of $I$ is $1+o(1)$. 

% Apart from the greedy approach, other methods including bio-inspired
% algorithms, have also been employed to solve lots of hard problems in 
% computer science including the SCS problem. 
% In \cite{Zaritsky2004}'s work, for example, four approaches for 
% finding solutions to the SCS problem: a 
% standard genetic algorithm, a novel cooperative-coevolutionary 
% algorithm, a benchmark greedy algorithm, and a parallel 
% coevolutionary-greedy approach have been compared. In the paper,
% the coevolutionary approach produced the best results.

% Zaritsky et al's \cite{Zaritsky2004} work served as the 
% foundation of this paper. Hence, the following algorithms,
% which have been explored and tested in the latter, have
% been extracted and validated 
% whether they are indeed generating
% good approximate solution to the SCS problem.

% \subsection{Greedy-SCS}

% The core idea of the greedy algorithm is to repeatedly merge
%  pairs of distinct strings with maximum overlap until only one remains.
%  It has been conjectured by \cite{MaierStorer1777} that the superstring
%  produced by the greedy algorithm is at most two times the optimal.
% Below is a pseudocode for the greedy algorithm:

% \begin{algorithm}[H]
% 	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
% 	\REQUIRE $R$ - set of strings
% 	\ENSURE superstring of set $R$
% 	\WHILE{||$R$|| > 1}
% 		\STATE choose $x_1 \neq x_2 \in R$ such that $overlap(x_1,x_2)$ is maximal 
% 		\STATE $R \leftarrow (R - \{x_1, x_2\}) \cup \{merge(x_1, x_2)\}$
% 	\ENDWHILE
% 	\RETURN remaining string in $R$
% 	\end{algorithmic}
% 	\caption{GREEDY(R)}
% 	\label{alg:seq}
% \end{algorithm}

% The greedy algorithm is probably the most widely used
% heuristic used in DNA-sequencing due to its simplicity and 
% constant performance guarantee which is most likely to be factor-2.

% \subsection{Genetic Algorithm}

% In this paper, we follow the standard model for the genetic algorithm (see Algorithm \ref{alg:gga}).
% That is, the algorithm generates an initial population of 
% random candidate solutions, then 
% the process of selection based on a defined fitness function,
% crossover, and mutation are used to evolve the next generation, of which
% each individual is then evaluated and
% assigned a fitness value. These steps are repeated a
% predefined number of times or until the solution is
% satisfactory. 


% \begin{algorithm}[H]
% 	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
% 	\STATE $t \leftarrow 0$ \{generation number\} 
% 	\STATE initialize Population$_{t}$ 
% 	\STATE evaluate(Population$_{t}$)
% 	\WHILE{termination condition not met}
% 		\STATE select individuals from Population$_{t}$ 
% 		\STATE recombine individuals
% 		\STATE mutate individuals	
% 		\STATE Population$_{t+1} \leftarrow $ newly created individuals
% 		\STATE $t \leftarrow t + 1$
% 		\STATE evaluate(Population$_{t}$) 			
% 	\ENDWHILE
% 	\RETURN solution derived from the best individual in Population$_{t}$
% 	\end{algorithmic}
% 	\caption{GENERIC GA()}
% 	\label{alg:gga}
% \end{algorithm}
