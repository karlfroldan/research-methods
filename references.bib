abstract = {From the Publisher: The design of algorithms for problem-solving lies at the heart of computer science. Concise yet authoritative, Algorithms: A Functional Programming Approach teaches the skills needed to master this essential subject. The authors challenge more traditional methods of teaching algorithms by using a functional programming context, with Haskell as the implementation language. This leads to smaller, clearer and more elegant programs which enable the programmer to understand the algorithm itself more quickly and to use that understanding to explore alternative solutions. Placing the emphasis on program development rather than the mathematical properties of algorithms, the book uses a succession of practical programming examples to develop in the reader problem-solving skills which can be easily transferred to other language paradigms. Key features of this innovative text include: Unmatched collection of functional programming algorithms A wealth of practical examples, bringing the algorithms into clear focus End of chapter exercises throughout Source code and selected solutions freely available online Comprehensive index and bibliographical notes Appendices on Haskell implementations and mathematical background For computer science students taking algorithms and/or functional programming courses, Algorithms: A Functional Programming Approach represents the ideal textbook. It is also an invaluable reference source of functional programs for practitioners.}

  abstract = {There has been significant recent interest in parallel graph processing due to the need to quickly analyze the large graphs available today. Many graph codes have been designed for distributed memory or external memory. However, today even the largest publicly-available real-world graph (the Hyperlink Web graph with over 3.5 billion vertices and 128 billion edges) can fit in the memory of a single commodity multicore server. Nevertheless, most experimental work in the literature report results on much smaller graphs, and the ones for the Hyperlink graph use distributed or external memory. Therefore, it is natural to ask whether we can efficiently solve a broad class of graph problems on this graph in memory. This paper shows that theoretically-efficient parallel graph algorithms can scale to the largest publicly-available graphs using a single machine with a terabyte of RAM, processing them in minutes. We give implementations of theoretically-efficient parallel algorithms for 13 important graph problems. We also present the optimizations and techniques that we used in our implementations, which were crucial in enabling us to process these large graphs quickly. We show that the running times of our implementations outperform existing state-of-the-art implementations on the largest real-world graphs. For many of the problems that we consider, this is the first time they have been solved on graphs at this scale. We provide a publicly-available benchmark suite containing our implementations.},
